# Capstone Project
## Goal
The goal of my capstone project is to calibrate an FSR matrix to the level that it can provide accurate readings. These readings will hopefully be able to tell thre pressure points of an object placed in the center of the matrix, as well as tell when something much lighter (a finger, for example) is present on the matrix at the same time.
## Materials
Some of the materials I'm using include:  
FSR Matrix (Male Terminal, 20kg Output Voltage)  
ADC (Analog Digital Convertor)  
16 Channel Multiplexor
