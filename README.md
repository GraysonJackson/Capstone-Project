# Capstone Project
## Goal
The goal of my capstone project is to calibrate an FSR matrix to the level that it can provide accurate readings. These readings will hopefully be able to tell thre pressure points of an object placed in the center of the matrix, as well as tell when something much lighter (a finger, for example) is present on the matrix at the same time.
## Materials
Some of the materials I'm using include:  
FSR Matrix (Male Terminal, 20kg Output Voltage)  
ADC (Analog Digital Convertor)  
16 Channel Multiplexer  
Arduino UNO
## Current Progress
9/12/2021: Currently, I have been reading numerous articles about FSR arrays, as well as documents on Arduinos and Multiplexers. I have aquired the Multiplexer components, but am currently still in the process of ataining the FSR array and an Arduino. Upon gathering all these items, I plan to test the Arduino in order ot learn basic functions before implementing the Multiplexer or Matrix.
